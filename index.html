    <h3>Desky</h3>
    <p>This application was developed at ICHack 2016. It is basically an android application which is compatible with all the VR headsets. The purpose of Desky is to stream all your linux desktop workspaces in 3D so that you can see all of them simultaneously. You have the option to focus on a particular screen and zoom in. This application was built using Unity with the backend server written in node.js</p>
    <p>P.S. This is my favourite project.</p>
